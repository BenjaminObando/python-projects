The functions and services for which a regional government is responsible are as follows-
Parliament shall by law-
a regional government shall be liable to a take-over of its administration by the President in a manner prescribed by an Act of Parliament and similar to the take-over of administration of a district under article 202 of this Constitution.
Unconditional grant is the minimum amount to be paid to the local governments to run the decentralised services. For a given fiscal year, this amount is equal to the amount paid to local governments in the preceding fiscal year for the same items adjusted[2] for general price changes plus or minus the budgeted cost of running added or subtracted services; calculated in accordance with the following formula-
Y1 = Y0 + bY0 + X1
= (1+b) Y0 + X1
Where Y1 is the minimum unconditional grant for the current fiscal year;
Y0 is the minimum unconditional grant in the preceding fiscal year;
b is the percentage change if any, in the general price levels in the preceding fiscal year; and
X1 is the net change in the budgeted cost of running added and subtracted services in the current year.
For the purposes of this formula, the current fiscal year shall be taken to commence with fiscal year 1995/96.
