the National Observatory for the prevention and the eradication of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity;
the National Security Council;
the Economic and Social Council;
the National Communication Council.
The Government guarantees these Councils the means necessary for their operations.
An organic law determines their missions, composition, organization and operations and can create others.
The President of the Republic has the top leadership of international negotiations. He signs and ratifies international treaties and agreements.
Peace treaties and commerce treaties, treaties relative to international organization, treaties which engage State finances, and those that modify legislative provisions as well as those which relate to the status of persons may only be ratified through a law.
The Republic of Burundi may create with other States international organizations of common administration and coordination and of free cooperation. It can end agreements of association or community with other States.
The treaties take effect only after having been ratified regularly, with reservations of their application by the other party in a bilateral treaty, and of the fulfillment of conditions for their enactment provided by them in a multilateral treaty.
Agreements authorizing toxic waste storage and the storage of other materials detrimental to the environment are prohibited.
The Defense and Security Corps may participate in international operations for the maintenance of peace in the world or within the framework of bilateral and multilateral agreements of cooperation. No Burundian force may be deployed beyond the national borders without prior authorization of the President of the Republic after consultation with the Vice President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and the National Security Council.
The National Assembly and the Senate must be informed within a period not exceeding seven days.
Any transfer, exchange, or addition of territory is invalid without the consent of the Burundian people through referendum.
When the Constitutional Court, referred to the matter by the President of the Republic, the President of the National Assembly, the President of the Senate, or a quarter of the members of the National Assembly or of the Senate, has declared that an international engagement contains a clause contrary to the Constitution, the authorization to ratify this engagement may only occur after an amendment or revision of the Constitution.
The initiative of the revision of the Constitution rests concurrently with the President of the Republic after consultation with the Government, to the National Assembly or to the Senate, deciding individually with an absolute majority of members.
The President of the Republic can submit for a referendum a bill of amendment of the Constitution.
No procedure of revision may be retained if it infringes the national unity, the cohesion of the Burundian People, the secularity of the State, the reconciliation, the democracy or the integrity of the territory of the Republic.
The bill or the proposal of amendment of the Constitution is adopted with the majority of four-fifths of the National Assembly members and of two-thirds of the Senate members.
While awaiting the establishment of the institutions arising from the elections in accordance with this Constitution, the institutions in place remain in operation until the effective installation of the new elected institutions.
The current members of the Constitutional Court remain in office until the establishment of new institutions arising from the 2020 election.
A period of five years is granted to the Senate to evaluate whether to end or to continue the system of ethnic quotas in the executive, legislative and judicial branches after the establishment of institutions arising from this Constitution.
As long as they are not contrary to the Constitution, the legislative and regulatory provisions, prior to taking effect, remain in application until their modification or repeal.
The Constitution of the Republic of Burundi adopted by referendum on February 28, 2005 and enacted on March 18, 2005 is thus revised.
This Constitution adopted by referendum on May 17, 2018 is in effect on the day of its enactment.
